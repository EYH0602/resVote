# To run
1. start the express server with `node expressMiddleware/express.js`
2. cd into resVote2.0 (`cd resVote2.0`) and run `npm start`

* Note: Make sure you have resVault set up on chrome. Currently I have mongo synced to main-net for resDB so connect to it.

# DO NOT RUN sync.js
* I don't know whether or not this will cause duplicates in mongoDB
